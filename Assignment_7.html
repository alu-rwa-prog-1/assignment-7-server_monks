<h1>Assignment 7</h1>
Congratulations for making it this far :) , I am proud of you<br>
Good news!!!! This assignment is easy !!<br>
You do not necessarily need to submit code in this assignment, <br>
We are testing how well can you design your classes <br>
When you are going to start a project here is what you have to do,<br>
Writing code can be very frustrating sometimes,but if you are well prepared, the job becomes much easier.<br>
Because we are going to work on our projects, this assignment is all about getting yourself ready
for the coding part of the project, <br><br>

Here is what you need to do: <br>

<ul>
<li>Create a file with your project proposal,</li>
<li>I need another file with all the classes that your program is going to have and
    the relationship between those classes.</li>
<li>Create a file for each of your classes, in that file,specify the instance variables of that class
    and for each method in the class write pseudo code of each.</li>
<li>After that ,still in the same file, write how you would test that class and different scenarios
    that you will test (I need at least 5 scenarios for each class)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
Here is how you will be graded<br>
Having all the needed classes in your project 10 marks<br>
Having each class well designed and pseudo code well written 50 marks<br>
Having at least 5 test cases for each class 40 marks<br>
