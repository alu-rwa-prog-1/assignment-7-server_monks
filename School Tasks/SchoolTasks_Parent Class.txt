Methods(Pseudo Code)


1. Edit task - This allows the user to make changes to the name of their task.


         Define edit_task:
        Input: Enter task name:
        If the task is available:
Input : What do you want to change it to?
                Task_name = (input value)
else: 
Output: Task not available
        


2. Remove task - This allows the user to remove a task


Define remove_task:
        Input: Enter task name
        If task is available:
                Delete task
         Else:
Output: Task not available


3. Mark-complete - This allows the user to mark a task as complete


Create method mark_complete:
        Enter task name/id
        If task is available:
                Set complete value to True
         else: 
output Task not available


4. Set reminder - this allows the user to set a reminder time(alarm) for their task


Define set_reminder:
        Input: Enter task name
        If task is available: 
Input time for a reminder
                Confirm reminder time is not past due date
Else:
 output Task not available
        
5. Check time remaining - allows the user to check the time remaining before the reminder goes off.


Define check_time:
        Enter task name
        If task is available: 
Get due date/time
                Get timedelta of due datetime - now
                Output timedelta
else: 
output Task not available
